% FINDROOT  Finds the root of a vector function, with vector-valued x0.
%  
% xstar = findroot(f, x0) performs a Newton search and returns xstar,
%   the root of the function f, starting with initial guess x0. The
%   function will typically be expressed with a function handle, e.g. 
%   @f.
%
%   Optional input findroot(f, x0, parms) includes parameters structure,
%   with fields dxtol (smallest allowable dx) and maxiter (max #
%   iterations).
%
%   Optional second output [xstar, cnvrg] = findroot... signals
%   successful convergence. It is set to 
%   false if maximum iterations is exceeded.
