function qs = assemblebwroot
% Finds the initial conditions for leg angles q1, q2, q3 that produce
% the desired step length and forward progression of the hip.
% Desired step length is 0.68 m, and forward progression of the hip
% refers to the amount the hip advances forward during double support,
% set to an amount 0.9*(foot length). Both of these values are set from
% human data, and the corresponding leg angles are solved for numerically.

% The q's are defined as q1: stance leg, q2: swing thigh, q3: swing
% shank. These are defined as positive in the counter-clockwise
% direction, measured from the vertical.

% The problem being solved is that the initial conditions do not 
% necessarily satisfy kinematic constraints, such as ensuring that
% the ballistic walking model starts with the trailing leg toe on
% the ground. The solution is numerically solved for a combination of
% the q's that satisfies this constraint.

% This version performs root finding to determine a unique assembly.
% The stance leg angle is set as an explicit constraint, so that
% the remaining two angles q2 and q3 are uniquely determined by the
% horizontal and vertical positions of the swing toe.

% YOU WILL NEED TO ADD CODE IN THREE LOCATIONS
% The rest of the program demonstrates a few other kinematic
% issues, but require no coding.

% Following parameter values are available in all subfunctions:
%  SL SPEED FWDP  lfoot l1 l2 l3

lfoot = 0.25; % foot length
lshank = 0.5; lthigh = 0.5; % segment lengths, thigh and shank
l1 = lshank + lthigh; L = l1; lstance = l1;  % stance leg
l2 = lthigh;
l3 = lshank; 
FWDP = 0.9*lfoot;   % forward progression of hip by end of double support

% The following constraints correspond to typical human walking
SL = 0.68;          % step length in m
SPEED = 1.25;       % nominal speed of 1.25 m/s

% This is the equivalent of Mochon & McMahon's equation (8):

% Another way to do the same iteration as in the jacobian method
% is to use our particular findroot function, which performs a Newton 
% search using the pseudo-inverse of the gradient. This yields a 
% configuration that minimizes the sum-squared deviations in the q's
% with each iteration. (Note that in other methods of root finding,
% it is not necessarily possible to find the root of a function with
% two elements, if the input has three elements as is the case here.)
