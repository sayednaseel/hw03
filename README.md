# Homework 03

See the [PDF assignment](HW03.pdf), or view as a [Jupyter notebook](HW03.ipynb).

When you accept the assignment, GitHub will clone the files into your own private repository. You may then clone those files onto your local machine. To submit assignment, commit changes and push your code back to GitHub.

For written parts of the assignment, any virtually any document type may be used. Most convenient may be to produce a Markdown document. You may also upload a pdf or other file. The assignment itself is produced with Jupyter notebook, which can be configured to run Matlab code and even include plots. Another option is to use Matlab Live Scripts, or Matlab Publish, to combine written information, Matlab code, and plots.

Jupyter notebook is a way to work interactively with languages such as Matlab, Python, and Julia. It allows code to be executed immediately, with plots embedded in the same document. Some students may find it worthwhile to install Jupyter, although the process is lengthy. Here is a good demonstration of Matlab and Jupyter notebook.
